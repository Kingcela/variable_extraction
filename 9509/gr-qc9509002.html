<p id="id21.1" class="ltx_p">In April of this year, the Executive Council of the American Physical
Society (APS) approved the formation of the Topical Group in Gravitation.
This action occurred in response to a petition to form such a group signed by
more than 240 APS members (with 200 signatures required). This number
included significant support from physicists whose main area of research is
not gravitation.</p>
</div>
<div id="id22" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id22.1" class="ltx_p">The objective of the Topical Group (TG) is to serve as a focus for research
in gravitational physics including experiments and observations related
to the detection and interpretation of gravitational waves, experimental
tests of gravitational theories, computational general relativity,
relativistic astrophysics, solutions to Einstein’s equations and their
properties, alternative theories of gravity, classical and quantum cosmology,
and quantum gravity. In order to function effectively to promote this
objective, it is important that the membership of the TG reflect as broad
a cross-section of workers in gravitational physics as is possible.</p>

<div id="id29" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id29.1" class="ltx_p">It should not be necessary for me to explain to the readership of this
Newsletter the major role played by Chandra in twentieth century science.
Nor do I feel it appropriate even to attempt to summarize here some of the
highlights of his extraordinary life and scientific career. Fortunately, the
full-length biography by Kameshwar Wali is available to give the reader a
good glimpse into his life. However, I do wish here to mark his passing by
making a few brief, personal remarks.</p>
</div>
<div id="id30" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id30.1" class="ltx_p">To those who had met him but did not get to know him well, Chandra must
have seemed an austere and formidable figure. There is some validity to
this impression, since he set the highest standards for himself with regard
to both intellectual rigor and personal integrity, and he was not tolerant of
failings by others in these matters – though much more tolerant of failings
by others than of his own failings or potential failings. Chandra was
particularly intolerant of scientists motivated primarily by the hope of
receiving recognition by others rather than by a deep, inner conviction
that their work was of importance and interest, whatever anyone else
might think. In order to get to know Chandra, it seemed that a barrier had
to be crossed. I believe that all that was needed to cross this barrier was
some expression to him of one’s inner convictions on research or other
intellectual endeavors. It is unfortunate that this barrier had the effect of
isolating Chandra from a portion of the scientific community. Once this
barrier was crossed, the very sensitive, caring, and, above all, loyal nature
of Chandra’s personality would become readily apparent. The combination
of these very human qualities of Chandra with his almost super-human
qualities of discipline, self-sacrifice, and dedication to science had a
profound and lasting effect on all those who knew him.</p>
</div>
<div id="id31" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id31.1" class="ltx_p">During the last ten years of his life, Chandra’s physical stamina declined
noticeably, but his interest in science, his discipline, and his fortitude did
not. His intellectual efforts in writing his recent book on Newton’s Principia
were undoubtedly as great as in any of his other major scientific
endeavors. It is very fortunate that he was able to bring these efforts to
completion this winter, less than six months before his passing. Even while
writing this final book, Chandra continued his lifelong pursuit of original
scientific research. In my last full-length conversation with him in early
August, he described what appeared to me to be a very promising
approach to giving a simple derivation of a formula for the gravitational
radiation emitted by a nearly Newtonian pulsating star within the
perturbation framework he had developed with Valeria Ferrari. His
enthusiasm for pursuing this research could not have been very different
than the enthusiasm he must have shown when he had begun doing
scientific research more than 65 years earlier. By chance, Valeria was
passing through Chicago that week on what she thought was going to be a
visit of a few days. Chandra lost no time in convincing her to stay an extra
week to do some calculations to verify the validity of the
approximation he had proposed. It is thus very fitting that Chandra lived
the last weeks of his life pursuing science in much the same manner as he
had done throughout his extraordinary scientific career.</p>

the arms to produce the required modulation at the point where the

<div id="id43" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id43.1" class="ltx_p">It is well known that the standard form of the 3+1 Einstein equations
consisting of evolution equations for the 3-metric and extrinsic
curvature, supplemented by prescriptions for determining the
kinematical variables the lapse and shift vector, is not manifestly
hyperbolic. To produce a d’Alembertian wave equation for the 3-metric
it is necessary to specify the harmonic coordinate condition thus
eliminating the “undesirable” second derivatives of the 3-metric
appearing in the Ricci tensor. The classic hyperbolic systems of
Choquet-Bruhat [1] and Fischer and Marsden [2] are based on this
harmonic coordinate condition.</p>
</div>
<div id="id44" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id44.1" class="ltx_p">In the past year there have been four independent attacks aimed at
formulating new hyperbolic versions of general relativity, a common
goal being to relax the restrictions of the 4-dimensional harmonic
condition. Several of these efforts have been motivated
by the “Grand Challenge” effort to simulate the inspiral and
coalescence of black hole binaries. Besides for the theoretical
advantages for global analysis, it is now widely believed that
manifestly hyperbolic evolution systems will be powerful tools
for numerical solution of the Einstein equations.</p>
</div>
<div id="id45" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id45.1" class="ltx_p">The primary obstacle to long-time simulations of black hole spacetimes
is that evolutions using singularity-avoiding foliations (such as
maximal slicing) freeze inside the event horizon leading
to the oft-discussed “throat stretching”. Attempting to
numerically resolve the rapidly growing throats for an
astrophysically interesting black hole collision scenario
while preserving reasonable accuracy
is certainly wasteful of computational resources
and currently, at least, beyond our capabilities. For this
reason, it is now expected that such simulations
will excise the interior of the black holes simply by ignoring
the spacetime inside the apparent horizon (which, assuming cosmic
censorship, lies inside the event horizon). Since there
are no general boundary conditions to apply at this surface,
one appeals to causal disconnection and ignores the field inside.
Thus it is clearly critical to have an evolution
system with mathematical characteristics which coincide with
the physical lightcone. This same feature greatly
simplifies the problems associated with applying <span id="id45.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">outer</span>
boundary conditions and extracting asymptotic gravitational waveforms;
the fields evolved by the code in the strong-field region can
be directly matched onto radiative variables in the exterior.
Another attractive aspect of such explicitly
hyperbolic evolution schemes is that numerical implementations
can exploit a wealth of sophisticated computational algorithms
developed for the studying the wave equation and the
equations of fluid dynamics.</p>
</div>
<div id="id46" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id46.1" class="ltx_p">Fritelli and Reula [3] have developed a first-order symmetric hyperbolic
formulation of general relativity which allows the Newtonian limit to
be taken in a rigorous way. The basic variables in their
system are the 3-metric, its momentum, and spatial derivatives
of the 3-metric (which obey a new constraint equation).
The lapse and shift vector may be chosen
arbitrarily – they do not propagate as part of the first-order system.
A somewhat similar approach, also starting with the usual form of the
3+1 Einstein equations has been recently published by
Bona, Masso, Seidel, and Stela [4] following up on earlier work
by Bona and Masso [5]. The basic variables for their system
include the 3-metric, extrinsic curvature, the lapse and shift vector
as well as spatial derivatives of
the lapse, shift, and 3-metric. They write the evolution system
in flux-conservative first-order symmetric hyperbolic form which
they diagonalize in order to obtain the characteristics.
It should be noted that the kinematical variables have characteristic
speeds in this system which can be different than the speed of light.
Bona et al. have tested their new system with numerical simulations
of Schwarzschild black holes using several different slicing conditions.
They have already seen substantial improvement over calculations using
the standard 3+1 equations.</p>
</div>
<div id="id47" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id47.1" class="ltx_p">The systems of van Putten and Eardley [6] and Choquet-Bruhat and York [7,8]
each involve going up one time-derivative from the usual
form of the Einstein equations and producing explicit wave equations
for the dynamical parts of the field. van Putten and Eardley,
using a tetrad formulation, start from the Bianchi identity and
form Yang Mills-like wave equations for the connection 1-forms.
The Choquet-Bruhat and York system is derived by taking a time-derivative
of the usual evolution equation for the extrinsic curvature
in a manner proposed by Choquet-Bruhat and Ruggeri [9]. (Related
ideas were pursued by Friedrich [10].)
By employing the momentum constraints, a quasi-linear wave equation
for the extrinsic curvature is formed for either harmonic slicing
or slicings where the trace of the extrinsic curvature is specified
in advance. The main difference between these approaches is
the choice of variables, tetrad vs. standard 3+1. In both
of these formulations wave equations are produced which are
spatially gauge-covariant.
It is also apparent that the 3-metric evolves but does not, in general,
propagate in a wavelike manner; it does not directly carry the
dynamical degrees of freedom but rather provides an
arena for the wave propagation. This physically intuitive feature
can be seen explicitly in the Choquet-Bruhat/York system by
choosing the harmonic time-slicing, reducing the formally third-order system
to first-order symmetric hyperbolic form, and
reading off the characteristic speeds of the fields. The 3-metric,
extrinsic curvature, lapse and acceleration all
propagate with zero speed; they are dragged along in a
direction normal to the foliation. Only the time-dependent tidal forces
have characteristic speeds equal to the speed of light.</p>

Surprisingly, it has recently been shown that ‘massless black holes’ play
an important role in string theory. They have appeared in at least two
different contexts, and in each case were instrumental in resolving
long standing problems. The first problem concerned the

string theory in ten dimensions, and the second involved some troubling

<p id="id63.1" class="ltx_p">A second example of massless black holes in string theory was provided
by Strominger [2]. A standard method of reducing string theory to
four dimensions is to compactify it on a six dimensional
manifold called a Calabi-Yau space. However, it has been known for
some time that this approach suffers from the following difficulty.
There are continuous deformations of the Calabi-Yau space which give
rise to scalar
‘moduli’ fields in four dimensions. In particular, there is a deformation
which corresponds to a three-surface in the Calabi-Yau space shrinking
down to zero size. At this point, the effective four dimensional
lagrangian becomes singular, since the kinetic energy term for one
of the moduli fields acquires a diverging coefficient.
(Notice that this is a singularity in the
action itself, and not a particular solution.) Strominger resolved this
singularity as follows. The ten dimensional theory contains three dimensional
extended objects surrounded by an event horizon [4] . One can think of them
as ‘black three-branes’. These objects carry a mass per unit three-volume

Now, when one compactifies on a Calabi-Yau space, this
black three-brane can wrap around a nontrivial three-surface in the compact
space. From the four dimensional viewpoint, the three-brane now
looks like an ordinary black hole. However, when the volume of the
three-surface
shrinks to zero, the mass of this black hole goes to zero. Near this point,
the black hole can no longer be treated classically, but instead
acts like another light ‘particle’ which should be included
in the low energy lagrangian.
Strominger has
shown that the singularity in the standard four dimensional action is exactly
what one would get if one views this as an effective action obtained by
starting with a nonsingular action with one additional
massless charged scalar field, and integrating it out.
Perhaps even more striking is the fact [5]
that one can use these massless black holes
to give an apparently nonsingular description of a transition from one
Calabi-Yau space to a topologically different one.</p>

elementary particles (or in string theory, just like other states of the

not carried by ordinary particles.
This clearly suggests that there may be no fundamental distinction between
extremal black holes and elementary particles.</p>

gravity wave detectors at LSU, Rome and Perth and with the recent
discovery of the TIGA configuration for an omnidirectional
detector we see very great advantages to operating resonant TIGA
detectors in coincidence with the upcoming LIGO and VIRGO
detectors. Carl Zhou’s paper in the last PRD shows that such a
configuration will be very powerful in determining a source’s
location in the sky. The gravity wave co-op has started to design
TIGA detectors to run in coincidence with the interferometers. As
shown by Johnson and Merkowitz we expect such detectors to be
more sensitive than the interferometers in their higher and
narrower frequency range. There are problems, however.</p>

<p id="id73.1" class="ltx_p">The gravity wave co-op has been told the only way that a new
detector can possibly be built is if there is a guaranteed source
for it to go after. It probably is not sufficient, we are told,
to depend on supernova sources since most recent models have a
much softer collapse and much less GW emission than we expected
several years ago.</p>

<div id="id74" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id74.1" class="ltx_p">Thomas Stevenson at the University of Maryland did an
estimate of the detectability of a NS-NS inspiral and merger,
based on the recent work of Centrella et al. His conclusion was
that, for a source at 15 Mpc, the signal to noise ratio in a
nearly quantum limited TIGA would be about 4 in the largest TIGA
that we can consider practical, a 60 tonne detector at 870 Hz.
That’s too low for a detection with only one detector and even
too low for a two detector coincidence. Most of the energy that
would be detected would come from the final few revolutions of
the inspiral with very little coming from the actual merger.
Warren Johnson and I had separately done a very cursory look at
Centrella’s results and came to a similar discouraging
conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div id="id75" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id75.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, there are those who argue that
Centrella’s work is just the first cut in a very difficult
problem and that a different model for the star could give vastly
different results. Williams and Tohline, for instance, used a
fluid model code to investigate inspiraling normal binary stars.
They found a bar like central region after the merger which
resulted in a very large time dependent quadrupole moment.
Tohline suspects that his code would give a similar result in the
NS-NS case. Some of us naively hope that the formation of rapidly
spinning black holes, perhaps at the end of a merger, will prove
to be an efficient source.</p>

possible sources, the type of statistics that we might expect
from these sources, and the character of the gravitational wave
signal that might be expected. The frequencies of interest to the
resonant detectors are those above 1 kHz. The detectors that we
know how to build will probably be pretty noisy above 3 or 4 kHz
so that is probably the upper limit of what we should consider
building.</p>

<p id="id81.1" class="ltx_p">The objectives of quantum cosmology are a description of the universe
in quantum mechanical terms, and, within that description, a theory of
the universe’s initial condition that makes testable predictions about
observations today. Early work on this subject concentrated on the
predictions of particular theories of the initial condition using
semiclassical approximations to quantum mechanics. More recently
there has been interest on the part of some quantum cosmologists, and
others in quantum gravity, in generalizing the usual framework of
quantum mechanics and in clarifying its interpretation when applied to
closed systems such as the universe. A somewhat representative (but
not exhaustive!) list of recent papers in this vein is given below.</p>
</div>
<div id="id82" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id82.1" class="ltx_p">The first reason that quantum cosmologists are interested in quantum
mechanics is that a generalization of the usual theory may be needed
to deal with quantum spacetime geometry. A fixed spacetime geometry is
central to the usual formulations of quantum mechanics, for instance,
to give meaning to the time which enters so basically. But, in a
quantum theory of gravity, spacetime geometry is not fixed. It is
rather a quantum dynamical variable, fluctuating and without definite
value. This conflict is called the “problem of time” in quantum
gravity. (For lucid reviews see refs [9,10].) A long investigated route
to a resolution of this question has been to keep quantum mechanics as
is, but find preferred time(s) in general relativity
[9,10,11]. Recently, however, there has been interest in the opposite
contrast – keep general relativity as is, but generalize quantum
theory, so that it does not require a fixed background spacetime, but
yields the usual theory in situations where spacetime geometry is
approximately fixed and can supply a fixed notion of time [12,13].</p>
</div>
<div id="id83" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id83.1" class="ltx_p">A second reason that quantum cosmologists are interested in quantum
mechanics is that, in applying quantum mechanics to the universe as a
whole, the interpretive difficulties of the subject are encountered in
an unavoidable manner. To utilize the probabilities of density
fluctuations at the time the observed universe was the size of an
elementary particle one needs to be clear about what these
probabilities mean! Phenomena such as classical behavior, that in the
familiar frameworks might be posited or taken for granted, now require
explanation in a wholly quantum universe. The range of ideas that
have been put forward for quantum frameworks for the universe as a
whole are well beyond what could be described or critically analyzed
in this small compass. One contrast that emerges is between those who
would put observers, measurement, and even consciousness in a central
position in quantum theory [1,2], and those who, with the aim of
precision, would expel these elements from so fundamental a role
[3-8].</p>
</div>
<div id="id84" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id84.1" class="ltx_p">How are we to evaluate generalizations of quantum mechanics that have
been proposed? How are we to distinguish between the various
interpretive ideas? The methods for doing this are standard in
physics. In cosmology we may ask: Are the proposed frameworks general
enough to calculate the probabilities for alternative behaviors of the
universe – its large scale behavior and that of everything inside it
including quantum spacetime? Are the frameworks logically consistent
and conceptually and mathematically precise? Do they allow the
assumptions of quantum theory to be stated more precisely and clarify
long standing issues of interpretation? Do they lead to calculations
of observable quantities that can be carried out in the near term? Do
they correctly and easily reproduce what is already well tested in
quantum mechanics and field theory? Do they differ one from another in
testable predictions? Do they further the research program of
understanding quantum gravity and the quantum origin of the universe?
</p>
</div>
<div id="id85" class="ltx_para">
<p id="id85.1" class="ltx_p">More important than the differences between the ideas under discussion
is the common thread that links them. By focusing on a program of
predicting the observable features of this largest of physical systems
from a theory of its quantum initial condition, we may be led to a
clearer and more general form of quantum theory – perhaps even with
implications for the laboratory.</p>

had cooled enough for the free electrons and nuclei to combine into
neutral atoms. From that time onwards, the photons, which interacted
only very weakly with the newly neutralized medium, began to freely
stream in all directions. Initially, the spectrum was perfectly
black body with a temperature of nearly 10,000 K. Over the
subsequent 10 billion years, the photon distribution red shifted due
to the expansion of the universe. The spectrum remains black body

<p id="id106.1" class="ltx_p">The key, unresolved issue is: What created the anisotropy in the first
place? A leading explanation is the inflationary [4] model of
the universe. In this model, the seeds of large-scale structure are
quantum fluctuations in the energy density generated when the
observable universe occupied a sub-nucleonic size just instants after
the big bang. There then followed a brief burst of extraordinary
superluminal expansion (<span id="id106.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">inflation</span>) in which the microscopic
quantum fluctuations were stretched into a spectrum of energy density
perturbations that span cosmic dimensions.</p>

fluctuation modes that perturb the CMB have wavelengths much shorter

Matter and radiation have had time to redistribute across the wavelength
before the CMB was emitted. In particular, there are
a series of acoustic oscillations
in which the matter and photons are drawn together by gravity and then bounce
back due to the radiation pressure. The effect of the acoustic oscillations
on the CMB photons is to produce the series of peaks shown in the figure.</p>

attracting masses. The measured acceleration of the turntable
then reflects the acceleration of the pendulum, while the fiber
never twists. This nicely avoids troublesome issues of fiber
deflection calibration and possible fiber nonlinearities. The
pendulum is to be a thin plate suspended vertically; thus its
quadrupole moment (which largely determines the gravitational
torque) is nearly proportional to its moment of inertia I. The
measured angular acceleration which determines G is then highly
insensitive to the mass distribution and geometry of the pendulum.
By also rotating the source masses and averaging over turntable
orientations, the effects of turntable readout nonlinearities and
ambient fixed gravitational fields are averaged out. Jens finds
measured turntable acceleration noise levels should allow a 100
ppm G determination in less than a day.

The pendulum will oscillate at one of five amplitudes between 2
and 9 radians at which the frequency shift as a function of
amplitude is an extremum and hence insensitive to error in
amplitude determination. Large amplitude operation raises
concerns of fiber nonlinear effects, which have often been viewed
as a possible source of systematic error in such experiments;
however our measurements of nonlinearities in an aluminum 5056
fiber at 4.2K, as reflected in the harmonic content and frequency
amplitude dependence of a symmetric pendulum operating at large
amplitudes, indicate that fiber nonlinearities should affect a G
measurement at a (correctable) level of only a few ppm.
Comparison of G values determined at a variety of oscillation
amplitudes will provide a powerful consistency check for
systematic effects. We aim for 20-50 ppm accuracy in an initial
experiment, with a goal of 1-5 ppm accuracy in a second phase
using fused silica source mass rings.</p>

<p id="id135.1" class="ltx_p">This strange way of looking at GR reveals a new side of the theory, and
emphasizes the peculiarity of general relativity. As Ted Newman puts it, a
conventional field theory describes propagation along characteristics of
certain operators; but general relativity is a theory determining its own
characteristics. He suggests that this result indicates that GR has such a
peculiar structure that no known form of quantum mechanics
could be merged with it. Certainly this beautiful result indicates that
general relativity is still capable of surprising us, and emphasizes how
deeply GR is a relational theory: the theory can be viewed as
a theory of the relative position –the position with respect to each
others– of overlaying foliations.</p>

<p id="id154.1" class="ltx_p">It is clear that the field has greatly developed since Choptuik’s
original discovery of critical phenomena in scalar field collapse.
Many other physical systems have now been shown to have a similar

relativistic fluid collapse), and studies have been performed both
in spherical and axial symmetry.

<p id="id158.1" class="ltx_p">The head-on collision of two black holes seems to be very well
understood. The numerical work of the NCSA-Washington University
collaboration has provided us with beautiful pictures of the
evolution of both apparent and event horizons. Of particular
interest has been the study of the dynamical oscillations of the
horizon geometry, as well as the caustic structure of the horizon
merger. This calculations where originally done in 2D and have
recently been repeated in 3D showing a very close agreement.</p>

<p id="id159.1" class="ltx_p">One of the most important results to emerge form the study of this

conference in an annual series at Penn State, the first two having
focused on numerical relativity and quantum geometry, respectively.
The Conference was divided into two parts: 2 days of invited and
contributed talks intended to give a broad overview of the field to
people who might be new to it, followed by a 2-day workshop concerned
more narrowly with coalescing neutron star and black hole binaries.
This workshop was the follow-up to a similar workshop held at Caltech in
Jan., 1994. Roughly 85 people attended part I of the Conference, with
the great majority also staying on for part II, the workshop. In part
I, the invited speakers and their titles were:</p>

<p id="id184.1" class="ltx_p">The somewhat unusual format chosen for the workshop seemed to work
rather well. Ten sets of scientific issues relating to binary
coalescence were identified, and then for each set one or two experts
in that area were chosen to moderate a (roughly) one-hour discussion.
The hour generally began with a short presentation by the expert(s)
that outlined the basic problems, which was followed by a few 5-minute
talks in which people described their latest (and often unpublished)
results in these areas, and ended with a group discussion. The group
discussions were often lively. One resulted in a bet between R. Price
and K. Thorne on the question of whether or not, in the final
coalescence of two spinning black holes with non-aligned spin axes,
most of the gravitational wave energy emitted after the inspiral phase
will essentially take the form of a simple, quasi-normal mode
ringdown. This question was related to an extended discussion on the
proper role of the BH Grand Challenge Project vis-a-vis LIGO.</p>

binaries ( <math id="id185.1.1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="&lt;" display="inline"><semantics id="id185.1.1.1a"><mo id="id185.1.1.1.1" xref="id185.1.1.1.1.cmml">&lt;</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id185.1.1.1b"><lt id="id185.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="id185.1.1.1.1"></lt></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="id185.1.1.1c">RELOP:less-than</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id185.1.1.1d">&lt;</annotation></semantics></math> 300 Megaflops, according to B.

interesting was the re-formulation by Will and Wiseman of the

Epstein-Wagoner approach.</p>

that a formal organization of theorists interested in LIGO-related
research should be created, in order to represent their concerns to
LIGO Management, to be a body to which LIGO Management can turn for
theoretical input, and to sponsor more meetings. A self-destructing
committee was appointed to write a charter and oversee the first
election of a Steering Committee for that organization.</p>

The next tri-annual international conference on General
Relativity and Gravitation will take place in Poona, India in December
of 1997. It will be hosted by the Inter-University Center for Astronomy
and Astrophysics (IUCAA). The conference was moved to December
because June and July fall in the monsoon season in India and because
December-January period is the best for travel within the country.
1997 was chosen (as opposed to 1998) to avoid conflict with the Texas
symposium. Professor E. T. Newman of University of‘ Pittsburgh will
serve as the Chair of the Scientific committee. If you have general
suggestions for the format of the scientific program –e.g. on
distribution of topics, number of workshops, etc– please let him know
soon. Planning for the conference will begin already this fall since
the committee has half a year less than usual to come up with the
program.</p>
